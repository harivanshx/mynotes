[[Distributed File System]]

A file system is the method an operating system uses to organize, manage, and store data on a storage device, like a hard drive or USB drive.

[[HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System]]


File system store the files as file blocks :

When data come into cluster then we need to divide data into blocks

Now the block size used is 128 mb but still it is configurable depending upon your requirements

If we are getting the file of 200 mb then it is divided into two blocks :

128 MB and 72 MB

For 300 MB file :

128MB 128MB :
