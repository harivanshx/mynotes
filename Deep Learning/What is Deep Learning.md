Deep Leaning is a subfiled of ai and mml that is inspired by structure of human brain 


Deep learngin attempts to draw similar conclusions as humans woul dby continuailly analyxing datta with given logical structure called neural network

Deep Learning Do 



WHy is deep leanring is ggettingh so famous 

 1.  Applicablility  - appplied to wider 

2. Performance - state of the art performance

Deep Learnign dont need feature engineering it do it by itself 


Point of differences from Deep Learnign and Machine Leanring


1. Deep Learning need more data

2. hARDWARE dEpendency -  costly and GPU needed


3. Training Time  -  Takes sometimes months to train the deep learning models and it requires a lot of efforts
4. Prediction time is fast in machine learning
5. Feature Scaling - Deep Learning model uses feature extraction by its own 
6. Interpretablity -  The Model is not interpretable as we dont really know the reason how does it works under the hood so thats why we say the deep learning is a black box 
- Deep learning will not replacce the machine learning in general as 



-- Why deep learning is getting famous now a days

- Hardware  -  Moore's Law -- Every two year the electronics and cost of transtors become twice and price become half -
	- Parallel procees we use to train machine learnign models and after that nvidia launched cuda so that we can work on the machine learning and nural network tasks with the help of graphs computing power
	- FPGA - field programmable gate array - they have a lot of power andtpu microsoft bing used it
	- TPU is used to run deep learning models 
	- NPU - Neural Processing Unit 
	- to start you can use cpu 
	- large -  gpu , 
	- Smartphone - smartphone cpu





- Datasets - It need a lot of data to work and after 2015 we start getting a lot and lot of data which is labled as faceboook and big company made the datasets public so that the community can learn and grow 
	- Datasets like google images , microsoft 
	- Wikipedia Data
	- Google Audio SYnc data with youtube sound clip
- Frameworks -  Tensorflow and py torch is like sklearn for machine learning
	- Kears is a intermediate library then we use keras with tensorflow but for research we all use pytorch 
	- Tensorflow + keras = industry 
	- Pytorch = For research purposes 
	- 
- Community - 
		People in deeo learnign workinhg from 1960 to 2011 they failed multiple times but they were so much believed that the things will change in the long run so for this they have workd day and night and now we can work on deep learning and nural networks
- Architecture - Deep learnign architectures work with node and edges you can crete diffeernt type of architectures and it depend upon problem , but we do have already used architecture and this is called as tranfer learning , we can use state of the art architecture 
- RESNET for image classification, BERT for text classification, UNET for image segmentationn,Pix2Pix Image Scaning,Yolo Object detection,Wave net Speech Generation
