Deep Leaning is a subfiled of ai and mml that is inspired by structure of human brain 


Deep learngin attempts to draw similar conclusions as humans woul dby continuailly analyxing datta with given logical structure called neural network

Deep Learning Do 



WHy is deep leanring is ggettingh so famous 

 1.  Applicablility  - appplied to wider 

2. Performance - state of the art performance

Deep Learnign dont need feature engineering it do it by itself 


Point of differences from Deep Learnign and Machine Leanring


1. Deep Learning need more data

2. hARDWARE dEpendency -  costly and GPU needed


3. Training Time  -  Takes sometimes months to train the deep learning models and it requires a lot of efforts
4. Prediction time is fast in machine learning
5. Feature Scaling - Deep Learning model uses feature extraction by its own 
6. Interpretablity -  The Model is not interpretable as we dont really know the reason how does it works under the hood so thats why we say the deep learning is a black box 
- Deep learning will not replacce the machine learning in general as 



-- Why deep learning is getting famous now a days

- Hardware  -  
- Datasets - It need a lot of data to work and after 2015 we start getting a lot and lot of data which is labled as faceboook and big company made the datasets public so that the community can learn and grow 
	- Datasets like google images , microsoft 
	- 
- Frameworks - 
- Community
- Architecture
