TheLazy evaluation, also known as non-strict evaluation or call-by-need evaluation, is a programming concept
where expressions are evaluated only when their result is required. This approach postpones the execution
of computations until they are actually needed, reducing unnecessary computation and improving efficiency.


Lazy evaluation is a strategy in  Apache spark that all the transformation is lazy in nature until and unless an action is applied .
