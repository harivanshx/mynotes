python indentation 
white space used by python 
all statement in a loop , conditionals 
it forces a certain level of visual structures 
good code with comments

you can use a backslash to continue a line 
you can wrap a statement in paranthesis 
syntax 



python is dynamic language so it does assign the datatype


everything in python is an object , an object in python is like any value it stores 
like if you write i =10
then you write i = "Hello "
so now i will be pointing to the memory location in which the object hello is stored 
the hello is an object here and now you might be thinking what did happen to 10 
if nothing points to object 10 then the garbage collector automatic clean it up from the memory 
as python is dynamic so you focus on the stuff that matter


 python is flexible but you need to keep track what data type it is currently using in the variable 
flexibility is the key concept of python and it is ease to use but you need to be mindful when to use which datatype
you can explicitly change the data type of the python

data types 
numbers 
- int , float  and complex numbers
- python keep arbitary memory so you dont need to assign which datatype you will be using currently 
- float for real numbers 
- std floating point numbers can have a tiny issue in python because how they stored in binary
- 0.1+0.2 != 0.3 sometimes
- for finencial uses we use the float module in python 
- python can have complex numbers

Text

- String 
- we use string in python for storing the character values or may be text 
- strings are immutable if we make a change to it the value will pass to some other locationn and a new 
- if you do string.upper() it will create a new object it does not change the string as it is 
- if we want to change the string we can not do it as they are immutable 
- formatting of the python
- you can use fstring which is more modern 


sequence:
 - for sequences we have list : list are mutable they are defined by square brackets.
 - you can slice lists 
 - if you want to change the containts of the list you can change them
 - you can also define a list which is a nested list 
 - nested lists are nothing but list inside a list 
 - so we pass an entire list to the list as an element and we can use multiple nesting in the list 
 - we can also split 
	 - we can also change the contains of the list just by using the perticuler index of the list if we try to change we can just like this
		 - list1 0= "55"
		 - just like this we can change it 
- extend
- insert
- pop
- push
- list are perfect for collection which need to grow , change and mutable


immutable sequences 
- here we can use tuple : if we use a tuple we can use by parenthesis and we can not change its size if defined once it stays like that 
- list can be used as keys in dictionaries 
- we can not use list as element in a tuple as tuple can not be changed but lists can 
- coordinates can not be modified using tuple


Dictionaries :
key value pairs : values can be anything 

key1 : "harivansh"

using .get method in lists 
we can use tuple 
fast lookups 
key value pairs 
keys are like words and they can not be duplicate
values can be anything and can be duplicated
you access a value you want to
