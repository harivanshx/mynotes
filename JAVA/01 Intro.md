**Anxiety is a common experience, and here’s how to manage it:**

1. **Talk to someone you trust** (e.g., a friend, family, or therapist).
2. **Focus on small, manageable steps** (e.g., a walk, a hobby, or rest).
3. **Practice self-care** (e.g., hydration, sunlight, or relaxation).
4. **Let go of the past** and center yourself in the present.

**Ethical note**: I’m not a healthcare professional, so I avoid making assumptions. Let me know if you’d like
more support! 😊'
