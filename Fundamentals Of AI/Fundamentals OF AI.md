❑Intelligence : “The capacity to learn and solve problems.”

❑Artificial Intelligence : Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of

human intelligence by machines.

1)The ability to solve problems.

2)The ability to act rationally.

3)The ability to act like humans.



}Computers with the ability to mimic or duplicate the functions of  the human brain.

}Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence of machines and the  branch of computer science which aims to create it.

}"The branch of computer science that is concerned with the  automation of intelligent behaviour" (Luger and Stubblefield.  1993).

•John McCarthy first introduced the term "Artificial Intelligence" in 1955

•He also developed Lisp, the second high-level programming after Fortran

John McCarthy was the first to describe the time-sharing model of computing

1. Reactive Machines

•Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.

•Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.

•These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.

•IBM's Deep Blue system,Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines.

2. Limited Memory

•Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.

•These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.

•Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed limit, and other information to navigate the road.

3. Theory of Mind

•Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.

•This type of AI machines are still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.

•Eg One real-world example of the theory of mind AI is Kismet, Sophia from Hanson Robotics 

 4. Self-Awareness

•Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.

•These machines will be smarter than human mind.

•Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.

•Supervised Learning is the most popular paradigm for performing machine learning operations.

•It is widely used for data where there is a precise mapping between input-output data.

•The dataset, in this case, is labeled, meaning that the algorithm identifies the features explicitly and carries out predictions or classification accordingly.

•As the training period progresses, the algorithm is able to identify the relationships between the two variables such that we can predict a new outcome.
