What is tc?
Why interviewer asks tc and scc 
different types of tc and sc 
rules to calculate tc and sc



Time taken to run the code is not the time complexity but it is the amount of time taken as a function with respect to the input is called as time complexity of the program 
it is the function of time related to the input size

if the size of input increase then ther will we more time taken but we dont refer to the time but we refer to the function of the time

### Big O notation
(O) notaiton 
so it work on the program by doing it we get the time sand space complexity of the project and by doing it we can find the operation on the project if i <6 then print anirudh and the value of i beome2
