- Can you describe diff between gen ai and traditional programming
	- Traditional programming is rule based and explicit 
	- where gen ai is probabilistic , it learn on data not hard coded , if we dont have a specific type of rules then we should use gen ai, but if you can do something without gen ai , then you must do it as 
- How would you approach to scale and design an automation workflow
	- Use modularity and do the things that you like to have , as modular code will help you to build and scale and debug your code easily 
	- Multiple programming task at a time like multiple jobs at there own pace
	- Asynchronous Programming 
- Describe a time where you have to optimize a process or workflow for efficiency or scalability 
	- to start these question you have to give your project or task and describe your project then you can get the latency and other things m consideer all the things in that and then what you can do is to use faster model and imporve api calls etc etc 
- What is an ai agent , what is its role in a broader system . 
	- The ai agent is an autonomous goal oriented system , which use
