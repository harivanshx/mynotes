[[Machine Learning]]



Scikit learn column transformers are here to solve a problem for multiple columns at once as it is so difficult to do it if we want to 

just like this table as you can see there are nominal and ordinal data together so you have to do one hot encoding , ordinal encoding and simple imputing togeter but it will create 3 new tables like that so this can be tedious and not optimal approach

so to carry that out what we will be doing is we will take the help of column transformers from sci kit learn


we can make that one numpy array with just one class named column transformers
