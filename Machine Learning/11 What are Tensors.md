### SO what are tensors 

- Tensor is a data structure
- Tensor is a container for numbers
- Matrix or Vector are also tensors

0D Tensors/Scaler

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array(4)
a

a.nd

```

[ 1,2,3,4 ]  = 1D tensor/vactor (axis =1) vector have 4 dimensions 


2D = No of axis = no of dimension


1D tensor is a vector but the dimension of that vector is the elements in that vector

0-5D tensors
- Rank / Axis  and Shape:
- No of axis = Rank = No of Dimension
- Shape is depend upon the row * col
- Shape will give the no of items as row * column

#### Example of 1D Tensors

- Students (10000)
- CGPA/IQ/State/Placement
- 8.1/91/WB/1
- 7.2/102/Kr/0

tensor is 1d but dimension of vector can differ as in this example it is a 1d Tensor
