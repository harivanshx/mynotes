- After batch machine Learning to solve the problem 

- Performance Will Improve after some use, Battery calibration , Usage Pattern recognition
- Promotions like according to use the performance of the model improve during the production environment 
- We have new data on the server and we have our model on the server it can be improved during the generation of new data 
- Examples : Swift key keyboard -> It learn your typing and enhence your experience by giving you good suggestion based on your writing style and it use its next word prediction very well. 
- Google Photos: 
- Youtube Feed:
- Instagram Feed: 
- Usage Of apps , apps suggesion on homescreen based on your usage on google pixel phones 
#### Use Cases
- Where there is a concept drift : Ecom , Stock Exchange ,
- Cost Saving : Work with tiny chunk 
- Faster Solution : 


Use it with the help of scikit learn :
use partial fit after fitting the data 
and again use partial fit 



#river This is a python library used to online machine learning 
#vowpal_wabbit it is also a library for online Machine Learning


### Learning Rate 
 - It decide how frequently we train the model 

#### Out of core learning 
- The data is too huge you can not even load it then you convert it into small chunks of date and then you give it to model
- It is like online learning but we use in offline just like batch learning

#### Disadvantage

- It is tricky
- It is a difficult Task .
- It is risky : Model Can be biased  , you have to create some technique for anomaly detection , offline then rollback to previous state and then put it online
