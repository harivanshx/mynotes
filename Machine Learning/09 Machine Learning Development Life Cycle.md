SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) :

##### MLDLC ( Machine Learning Development Life Cycle ):

1. Problem Framing
2. Data Gathering -
	- We get data through kaggle 
	- but in real life we need data from different sources 
	- can be from api or can be scrape through web scraping
3. Data Preprocessing -
	1. Remove Duplicates
	2. Remove Missing Values
	3. Remove Outliers
	4. Scale the data by standerdization
4. Exploratory Data Analysis - 
	- Visulize the data 
	- Outlier detection 
	- Univariate or bivariate
	- Imbalance data to balance data 
	- get concrete idea of the data 
5. Feature Engineering and Selection 
	- Create new feature or change the existing features
	- Remove the unused features
	- select the features which are necessary
6. Model Training , Evaluation and Selection 
	- Ensamle Learning 
	- Train the machine on different models and then evaluate them 
7. Model Deployment 
	- Model to server and online 
8. Beta Testing 
	- Rollout the new features to loyal costumers to try and give feedback of the feature 
9. Optimize 
	- Model Optimization on 
	- Backup
	- Data
	- Load balancing 
	- Retraining Time
