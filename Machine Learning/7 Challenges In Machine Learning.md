#### Data Collection :
- Through API
- Via Web Scrapping
#### Insufficient Data / Labelled Data:

#### Non Representative Data :
- 2021 T20 Worldcup who will win but you collected data from india only but what you should do is data collection 
- sampling Bias
- Sampling Noise
- Data Representation should be good

#### Poor Quality Data
- 60 percent of time goes to improve quality of data.
- Data need to be cleaned before working on the data

#### Irrelevant Features
- Garbage in is Garbage out 
- Feature Engineering Need to be done

#### Over Fitting
- Remember the data points but don't learn from the data
- in a city you go to movie-hall but you found out the tickets are for 1200 inr so you make a conclusion that this city is expensive .

#### Underfitting

- when you make the model so much simple

#### Software Integration

- Machine Learning Algo at the end is make to become a part of the software .
- For software we have a lot of operating system and languages 
- like java dont work on machine learning that can be difficult work for the machine learning engineer 
#### Offline Learning / Deployment


#### Cost Involved

- Read the Paper the cost of AI
- Hidden Cost Of Machine Learning




##### TL;DR
- Whenever you try to do ml , make your machine learning model into a proper product and deploy that product on the server and send that product to the actual users 
- MLOps : Machine Learning Operations .... AWS , Jenkins, Github, Etc Etc
