# Agenda

- Intro To ML (AI vs ML vs DL vs Ds )
- Supervised ML and Unsupervised Ml
- Linear Regression (Maths and Geimatric Intution)


### AI vs Ml vs Dl vs DS

Universe is AI -  It is a process in which the application able to perform its task without human intervention 
Ex - Netflix Recommendation System , Amazon Recommendation for frequesntly bought , Ai engine 
Business driven goals
Self  Driving Cars >> Tesla 
at the end of the day > AI Engineer


## Machine Learning 
It is a subset of AI which provide stats tools to analize the data 
visualize the data for prediction and forcasting 
of the data in the long run 


## DL 
The plan is to mimic the human brain 
for this we use multi layred neural network 
because of dl we are able to solve such a complex complex use cases

## Data Science
The data scientist you will be part of everything 
machine learning and deel learning

Key Components of Machine Learning 
1. **Data:** Foundation for any ML model — the quality and quantity of data directly affect performance.
2. **Features:** Attributes or input variables used to make predictions. 
3. **Model:** The mathematical structure that learns from data.
4. **Training:** The process of feeding data to the model to make it learn patterns. 
5. **Testing:** Evaluating the model’s performance on unseen data. 
6. **Evaluation:** Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess performance



Types of Machine Learning 
1. **Supervised Learning:** Model learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Model identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Mix of labeled and unlabeled data. 
4. **Reinforcement Learning:** Model learns by trial and error to maximize rewards (e.g., self-driving cars, gaming).

Animated Pipeline (5 boxes): 
1. Data Collection → CSV  file
2. Preprocessing → Cleaning brush 
3. Training → Brain lifting weights 
4. Evaluation → Accuracy meter 
5. Deployment → Rocket launch



Applications of Machine Learning
- Spam Detection
- Image & Speech Recognition
- Healthcare Diagnosis
- Fraud Detection- Recommendation Systems (Netflix, YouTube)
- Predictive Maintenance




Supervised Machine Learning :

![[Pasted image 20251007152700.png]]


create a model whenever we take new age it will give us weight 

this model is also called hypothesis

- Independent feature = Age 
- Dependend Feature = Weight 
as weight depends upon age 
there will be one dependent feature 




#### Regression and Classification

Regression :

![[Pasted image 20251007152909.png]]

Find the predected point 
- For regression problem your output be a contineous variable




#### Classification Problem

No of hours   No of play hours   No of Sleep hours  O/P(pass of fail)


if 2 outputs then binary classification 
if more then 2 then it is a multi class classification 



### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction 


Salary    Age      


Here we wil create cluster for costumer segmentation 

![[Pasted image 20251007153246.png]]


grouping them together 
and if i want to target a product for different kind of people 

add marketing use customer segmentationn


#### Dimensionality Reduction

if we have 1000 features can ve reduce those featuers to lower dimension 

clustering is a grouping algorithm

10. SVM
11. KNN






## Linear Regression 

Lets say we have 2 features and for these 2 features we have data points 
we will create a model based on the traning data set 
we will find the best fit line for the prediction

y is a linear function of x


y= mx+c  is the equation 


Andrew NG :::: Best Teacher for Machine Learning

![[Pasted image 20251007154829.png]]
but how many iteration we need to do before reaching the best fit line  ??


![[Pasted image 20251007154856.png]]


to tackle this problem we should start with one point and then we should go to find the best fit line got the cost function
