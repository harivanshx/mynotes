[[Machine Learning]]


on the bases of supervision we have 3 types of machine learning 

1. Supervised Machine Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
3. Semi Supervised Machine Learning


### 1.  [[Supervised Machine Learning]]

1. [[Regression]] : If target column is numeric so it is a regression analysis
Example : Package of students , Sales number, Age , IQ, CGPA ,House Price Prediction etc.
2. [[Classification]] : If target column is categorical so it is a classification 
Example : SPAM or Not, Rain or Not Rain , Dog or Not, Goat or Cat etc . 




### 2. [[Unsupervised Machine Learning ]]


1. Clustering 
2. Dimensionality Reduction 
3. Anomaly Detection 
4. Association 

f



1. Clustering :

Divide Datapoints into group , it is a powerful technique 






1. Dimensionality Reduction :
	If we have a 1000 input column and we dont need that much input column so we remove the seperate column by feature extraction and remove those extra column . 

	For graph Plotting we use only few  2 - 3 data columns for our graph 



2. Anomaly Detection :
	for normal data points we

	Anomaly Detaction works on the data points which exceed the limit of the data
	These data points are too far from the similar data points and it can create chaos in the model and can influence our result


3. Association :

	Properly organized products is a problem :
	we will use association by scan the previous bills and associate the similar products together .
	Wallmart Employee : Baby dippers and bear stack together and if they have this there sales increase day by day . this is an interesting use case 
	
### 3. [[Semi Supervised Learning]]

Label data we have less and so thats why we use some of the 

Google Photos Clustering : as a user i just have labeled just one photo and all of the photos tagged by that label 


### 4. [[Reinforcement Learning]]

Self Driving Cars , Agent Learning  in a given environment by learning in the multiple possibilities by finding the best decision , agent just have policies and we have reward and punishment and it improve it policies and then it learn through that reward maximization process.

Alpha Go wins the  Go game by beating the world champion in that game \
