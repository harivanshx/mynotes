- Feature Scaling is a technique which deals with the feature to standerdize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range so that it is easy to get the data and learn about the data in the graph because if we dont do that our visualization become so much of the bad side as it become very difficult in playing larger data ranges


chote range me lana is feature scaling so that we can able to look at data in a representable form

Also called as Z score normalization

xi\ = ( xi - mean )/sd


new series mean = 0 and sd =1




Normalization and Standardization 


suppose if you have a usecase means you have data in which we have dependent and independent feature and by using independent feature you have to find the independent features
