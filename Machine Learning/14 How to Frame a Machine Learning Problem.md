# Framing Machine Learning Problem from a simple problem 





[[Machine Learning]]

##### Series of Steps

- Lets take example of netflix
- How we can improve the revenue of netflix 
	1. New costumers
	2. Hold the exestace consumers by reducing the churn rate of the consumers .

churn rate is 4% and if you can reduce it to 3.75 then it is so good for netflix 

business problem is increase revanue then you convert that problem into churn rate 

business problem to mathematical problem 

you have to see the #big_picture 


If you want to reduce the churn rate you have to identify the costumers who  are lefting the 

what can be the problem related to costumer 
we will give him instiant discount on his subscription 

so we can say it is a classification problem 
but what if someone has a larger tendency of quiting but the other person have a less tendancy of quiting the platform so we can not give both of them the same discount on the subscription so we need to give both of them some different discount so that the person 

we need to find the probability to leaving for each consumer 
so it is not a classification problem but it is a regression problem 


- what current solutions we have right now 
		- as there is a model which give us the churn rate by calculating it 
		- now we also need to know what data we want 
		- after getting that data 


here what data engineer will do is from oltp he will create a data warehouse which help the machine learning engineer,
