## Offline Vs Online Learning 

### Production
	Production is a server on which you deploy your code and it is called production environment and based on that learning we have 2 types of learning
	1. Batch Learning
	2. Online Machine Learning


## Batch Learning 

- In batch machine Learning there is no incremental training , you just give your whole data and you make the machine learn through all of that data . you take up your entire data and train your machine on that data in your offline system and after training that machine on that data you deploy that model to the online or the production environment .

- Problem is that you can not update this model as it does not support incremental changes and for that you have to train the model again from scratch 
- If you have large amount of data there will be a time that your tools will not able to support that large dataset and your machine learning model will not be trained and it will require more computational power and sometimes you will also not able to give the entire data to the model your code will be broken. 
- Hardware Limitation 
- Availability of the data : Like if we dont have that data which we need at this time so that can be a problem , just suppose you are browsing that internet and your news website have thrown you in the group of tech and science but there is an emergency in the country then that news group is so important for you but the machine learning model will updata in every 24 hour then this can be a major concern because if we think about it if you get into the group of that new after 24 hour then this will be a huge issue and you can loose yourself
